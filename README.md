# ⚡ Hey, I'm Himanshu Neeraj!

### 🤖 Aspiring AI Generalist | Content Creator | Tech Explorer

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I’m an AI student on a mission to master the full stack of Artificial Intelligence—from the math that powers the models to the code that deploys them.

I don't just like AI; I'm obsessed with how it solves real-world problems. I keep things straight-forward: **Code it, Test it, Ship it.**

### 🛠️ The Tech Stack (My Arsenal)

I believe a true Generalist needs a well-rounded toolkit. Here is what I am working with:

* **Languages:** Python (Main), JavaScript, SQL
* **AI/Data:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git/GitHub, VS Code

### 🔭 Highlighted Projects

Here is the code behind the madness. Check out my top repositories:

#### 1. 🌐 [Himanshu-Neeraj-Portfolio](https://github.com/himanshu-neeraj/Himanshu-Neeraj-Portfolio)
> *The hub of my digital identity.*
This isn't just a landing page; it's a showcase built with **JavaScript**. It serves as the central point for my work, blog posts, and project updates.

#### 2. 🐍 [The Python Grimoire (Python)](https://github.com/himanshu-neeraj/Python)
> *From "Hello World" to Advanced Logic.*
Originally a comprehensive college assignment, this has evolved into a massive library of Python theory and code examples. If you need a reference for syntax or logic, it's probably in here.

#### 3. 📊 [Visualization-Tools](https://github.com/himanshu-neeraj/Visualization-Tools)
> *Making Data Talk.*
Data is useless if you can't understand it. This repo explores various visualization techniques to turn raw numbers into actionable insights.

#### 4. 🧮 [Computational-Techniques](https://github.com/himanshu-neeraj/Computational-Techniques)
> *The Math behind the Magic.*
AI isn't magic; it's math. This repo dives into the numerical methods and computational logic that power the algorithms we use every day.

#### 5. 💾 [SQL-Programming](https://github.com/himanshu-neeraj/SQL-Programming-)
> *Data Wrangling HQ.*
Because before you can train a model, you have to get the data out of the database.

### 📹 Beyond the Code: YouTube & Content

I believe in building in public and sharing what I learn. When I'm not debugging code, I'm creating content.

* **📺 [My YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheHimsShow):** I break down tech concepts, share my journey, and sometimes just rant about bugs.
* **Check out my latest video:** *[Is Sanskrit a computer friendly laguage?]*
